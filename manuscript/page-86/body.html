<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Exercise</h3><p class="  start-chapter">No. 34 is a landscape reduced to its main lines, all detail being omitted.</p><p>Make an enlarged copy of this, or design a similar one. Then, in the attempt to find the best proportion and the best way of setting the subject upon canvas or paper, arrange this in rectangles of varying shape, some nearly square, others tall, others long and narrow horizontally as in No. 35. To bring the whole landscape into all these will not, of course, be possible, but in each the essential lines must be retained.</p><p>Draw in ink after preliminary studies with pencil or charcoal, correcting errors by tracing.</p></div> </div>
