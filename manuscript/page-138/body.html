<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">decoration. This use of the word is misleading to the student; we do not speak of music and poetry as âdecorativeâ. Lines, tones and colors may be used to decorate something, but they may be simply beautiful in themselves, in which case they are no more decorative than music. This word should be dropped from the art vocabulary.</p></div> </div>
