<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">requires dexterity and much practice. Paper must be stretched or thumb-tacked perfectly smooth; ink-stone, dishes and brushes must be clean. For a beginning take a simple line pattern; decide which parts shall be white; then wash a middle tone of gray over the rest. When dry, paint in the black spaces.</p><p>The reason for keeping a tone flat is that the value of a whole space can be judged better; if it is sloppy and uneven it loses force and interest. In beginners' work,   and in design, flatness is necessary, but in picture-painting purely flat tones would rarely be used.</p></div> </div>
