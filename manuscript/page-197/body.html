In No. 63 are shown two experiments in composing with HUE.</p><p>NOTAN of COLOR. Draw in outline six scales, as shown in the diagram. Paint N in white, black and three grays (see page 88). In the spaces marked (a) paint each of the five huesâred, yellow, green, blue and purple, middle value and equal intensity.</p><img class="overlay center" width = "91%" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/composition/master/assets/images/colors2.jpg" /><p>Next, paint a lighter value (b) and a darker (c) making a notan-scale of each hue,âlight red, middle red, dark red, etc. Observe that intensity diminishes toward light and dark. If the intermediates, yellow-red, green-yellow and the rest, are also arranged in this way from light to dark, you will have a set of notes for application in composition.</p></div> </div>
