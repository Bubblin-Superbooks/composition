<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Japanese art, when influenced by Zen philosophy, as Okakura Kakuzo tells us in âThe Book of Teaâ, avoids symmetry as uninteresting. In Gothic art, the product of richly inventive and imaginative minds, symmetry was never used in a commonplace way.</p><p>This Principle of Compositionâwhen united to fine spacing,âproduces, in architecture an effect of repose and completeness; in design a type of severely beautiful form, as seen in a Greek vase or the treasures of the Sho-so-in at Nara where so much of the older Japanese art has been preserved.</p><p>A few examples of Symmetry are given here; the student will readily find others. Exercises can be easily devised, following the steps suggested under other principles. See opposite, and Nos. 42, 43.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">PROPORTION or GOOD SPACING. Principles of Composition, I must repeat, are only ways of arranging lines and shapes; art is not produced by them</p></div> </div>
