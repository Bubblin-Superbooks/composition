<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">white.</p><p>INTENSITY. Color varies not only in hue and value, but in intensity,âranging from bright to gray. Every painter knows that a brilliant bit of color, set in grayer tones of the same or neighboring hues, will illuminate the whole group,âa distinguished and elusive harmony. The fire opal has a single point of intense scarlet, melting into pearl; the clear evening sky is like this when from the sunken sun the red-orange light grades away through yellow and green to steel-gray.</p><p>This rarely beautiful quality of color can be better understood by isolating it and testing it in designs (as has been done with each principle, from Line onward; see page 21).</p><p>Paint a scale with one hue, say Vermilion, keeping each space of the same value, but grading the intensity down to neutral gray.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">APPLICATION.
