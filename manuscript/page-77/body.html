<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">something better; yet even this is less offensive than the kind that pretends to be art,âbad in line and glittering with false decoration.</p><p>Pottery, like other craft-products, is truly useful when it represents the best workmanship, combined with feeling for shape, tone, texture and color,âin a word, fine art.</p><p>Such quality is found, to mention only a few cases, in some of the âpeasant waresâ; in the best Japanese pottery, ancient and modern; in Chinese, especially of the Sung period (A. D. 960-1280) in Moorish, Persian, Rhodian and Greek. When each maker tried to improve up older models, and had the taste and inventive genius to do it, the art grew to supreme excellence; even fragments such handicraft are now precious. The difference between the contours a really great piece of pottery and ordinary one may seem very slight, but in just this little difference lies the art.</p></div> </div>
