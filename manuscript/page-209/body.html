<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>TWO and THREE HUES. If two hues are introduced the complexity will be greater, but there will be more chances for invention and variation. With at least ten hues to choose fromâR, YR, Y, GY, G, BG, B, PB, P, RPâeach one of which might have perhaps four degrees of intensity (from very bright to dull) the student has material to compose in any key. Two typical scales are given below:</p><p>Two huesâ</p><p>White</p><p>Light yellow</p><p>Middle gray</p><p>Dark green</p><p>Black</p><p>Three huesâ</p><p>White</p><p>Light yellow</p><p>Middle gray-green</p></div> </div>
