<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Exercise</h3><p class="  start-chapter">Choose a landscape with a variety of large and small spaces.</p><p>1. Compose this within a border (see Chap. VI.) and when the spacing is good trace with the brush on several sheets of Japanese paper.</p><p>Next try the effect of painting certain spaces black, or dark gray, or some dark color like blue. The other spaces may be left white, or painted light gray or with light color. Landscapes are capable of a great many two-value arrangements but not all such will be fine. Strive for harmony rather than number, variety or strangeness. Compare your set and select the best.</p></div> </div>
