<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Cover the paper with a very sketchy tone of soft charcoal; pass over it lightly with a paper stump or piece of cotton cloth. Be careful not to grind the black into the paper, making an opaque smoky tone. Charcoal paper is made rough, to let the   warm white shine between the little particles of black that lie upon the points of the surface.</p><img class="overlay center" width = "97%" src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/composition/master/assets/images/no_54a.jpg" /><p>When a luminous middle-gray is obtained, sketch in the darks with soft charcoal and take out the lights with bread or rubber; this effect is like a mezzotint, Nos. 55, 57, and p. 57. After the principle of three values has been demonstrated, and the student can appreciate definite intervals of tone, the instructor should allow great freedom in execution, not even limiting to three notes but adding one or two others if necessary to good expression.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">For oil painting, mix the three tones in quantity</p></div> </div>
