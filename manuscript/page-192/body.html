Mr. Munsell adopts these and two secondaries, Yellow and Purpleâfive hues in allâas the basis of all color expression in art. This seems very simple and quite sufficient for working out all problems in color scheming. Note. Experiments as outlined below, are intended only to set the student thinking, in an orderly way, about the three dimensions of color.</p></div> </div>
